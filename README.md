# NeverTooLate

Few months ago, when the final English exam was coming I thought that is difficult thing to learn a lot of words on the same time.
Moreover I wanted to create app for testing level of mastering vocabulary. So, on this way my app was created.<br>

Main menu has three modes:
<ul><li>New lesson</li>
<li>Load lesson</li>
<li>Settings</li>
</ul>

On <i>New lesson</i> we can add new lesson and type words.Then we can load our lesson and start learning or testing.
There are two modes available (from polish to english or vice versa). Every score on <i>Test mode</i> can be save.
<i>Settings mode</i> allow us to delete any lesson and see top scores of tests.
